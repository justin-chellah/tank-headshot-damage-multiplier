# [L4D/2] Tank Headshot Damage Multiplier
This is a simple SourceMod Plugin that "adds" a head hitbox for tanks and lets survivor players inflict extra damage when doing headshots against them, except for melee weapons as those already do a lot of damage. As tanks are very powerful, this plugin can be handy if you want to reward players for being able to hit headshots on them as their heads are quite small.
